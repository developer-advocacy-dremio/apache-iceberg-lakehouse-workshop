## What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this workshop, we will walk through:

- How to connect **Apache Iceberg catalogs** to Dremio, including external catalogs like Nessie, Glue, and Polaris
- The capabilities and benefits of **Dremioâ€™s integrated Iceberg catalog**
- How Dremio delivers **end-to-end performance management** for Apache Iceberg tables through features like reflections, caching, and table optimization
- An overview of additional **Dremio features**, including:
  - The **Semantic Layer** for defining and curating business-friendly datasets
  - **Semantic Search** for discovering data using natural language
  - **Wikis** and other collaboration tools that make data documentation seamless and accessible

## ðŸ›  Requirements

To complete the exercises in this workshop, you will need the following:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running on your machine
- Access to a **Dremio Enterprise Edition** environment (either self-hosted or cloud-based)

> **Note:** Some features covered in this workshopâ€”such as the integrated catalog, autonomous performance management, and semantic searchâ€”are exclusive to Dremio Enterprise Edition.

## No Enterprise Access? Try the Self-Guided Tutorial

If you donâ€™t currently have access to Dremio Enterprise Edition, you can still gain valuable hands-on experience by following a self-guided tutorial using Docker and **Dremio Community Edition**.

This tutorial covers:

- How to connect external Apache Iceberg catalogs to Dremio
- How to explore and query Iceberg tables
- How to use Dremioâ€™s Semantic Layer with virtual datasets
